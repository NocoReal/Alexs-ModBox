# My own version of **Garry's Mod** in Unity (It's very bare bones)

## It features **4 different shapes** to place in the playground **and** a *RGB selecter* to change the color of the object and an HSV selector for people who prefer that!

You can also make them *Transparent* and change the opacity

## The movement script is made to recreate the Source engine's movement completely (took me a lot to create and isnt yet perfect or complete)
